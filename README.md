- X86 Assembly
- 2816 Assembly (My own Architecture for the Commander 64 Fantasy Computer)

- Blender (Not programming related but helps with gamedev)
- Bootstrap (The web development library)
- C 
- C++
- C#
- CSS
- HTML
- Javascript
- JSON
- MongoDB (I've done some stuff with python and Mongodb)
- OpenGL (Not great with it, SDL is my prefered graphics library)
- Python
- Pygame
- React.js
- SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer is a graphics library for C and C++)
- Tkinter (A library for python)

I love working with old technologies and learning about how old computers work, I also enjoy game development.

For some reason when i first joined this site i made repos for lots of stupid Javascript and Python projects that were prototypes for things (Like Online games, Pygame, Using CSS ect..). I need to private these repos so please ignore them.
